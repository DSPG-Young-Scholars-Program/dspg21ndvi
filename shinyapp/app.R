                                          off of existing satellite pairs. The model

                                          Virginia. This is the region that the model 
                                          was initially trained on. Raw satellite 
                                          images were downloaded from the Earth Explorer 
                                          via the United States Geological survey 
                                          as Geotiff images of the different wavelengths 
                                          of light captured. A great deal of data 
                                          cleaning, conditioning and filtering had 
                                          to be performed before the images could 
                                          be fed into a machine learning model. The 
                                            first such problem came when the raw 
                                            images were encoded as 16-bit positive 
                                            integer values, and needed to be converted 
                                            to 64-bit floating point values in order 
                                            to be manipulated. Otherwise, non-natural 
                                            values result in high-values instead 
                                            of negative ones that make the resulting

Therefore, the team had to be very precise in our corrections between these two images.

This produced large color discrepancies in major landforms like water, lakes, ponds and urban areas which were easy to identify and correct for. Once the pictures were properly aligned, the distinct changes in color disappeared. A visualization of an example correction via subtracting the NIR bands is shown to the left.

The existing literature on these constructed indices apply these indices in precision agriculture and planned farming. These measures are also used in various environmental policy design, including management of forest fires, drought management, coastal and inland flooding, urban green space management, etc. NDVI is an index primarily related to canopy chlorophyll content (Jackson et al., 2004) and one of the most widely used indexes for the remote sensing of vegetation (Piragnolo et al., 2014; Gao et al., 1996). The NDWI is a measure of liquid water molecules in vegetation canopies that interact with the incoming solar radiation (Gao et al., 1996), specially conceived for the estimate of soil moisture and canopy water content (Jackson et al., 2004; Sánchez-Ruiz, 2014). The NDWI is often a function of local climate and soil properties controlling water availability (Sánchez-Ruiz, 2014), and sensitive to changes in liquid water because it incorporates a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band. This green vegetation spectra region is dominated by water absorption effects that capture important information on seasonally variable water status (Sánchez-Ruiz, 2014; Wang et al., 2011).
